C++ Graph Algorithms
====================

I have developed these small programs as a project for a graduate discipline. At the time was very hard to find any simple and understandable implementations of some common graph algorithms. Because of that I decided to open these implementation in order to help any other student of graph theory. 

Algorithms implemented:

1. Isomorphism Test: Applies some heuristics to discover if two graphs are isomorphics (Works well for non-regular graphs);

2. Planarity Test: An implementation of Demoucron, Malgrange and Pertuiset algorithms to discovers if a graph is planar or not

3. Hungarian Algorithm: An implementation of Hungarian Algorithm to find a maximum matching on Complete Bipartite Graphs (Km,n)
